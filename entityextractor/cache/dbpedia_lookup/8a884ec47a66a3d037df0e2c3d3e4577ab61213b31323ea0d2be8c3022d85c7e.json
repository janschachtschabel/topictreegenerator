{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ribosome", "label": "Ribosome", "abstract": "Ribosomes () (named also Palade's corpuscles) comprise a complex macromolecular machine, found within all living cells, that serves as the site of biological protein synthesis (translation). Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. Ribosomes consist of two major components: the small ribosomal subunits, which read the mRNA, and the large subunits, which join amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. Each subunit consists of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and a variety of ribosomal proteins (r-protein or rProtein). The ribosomes and associated molecules are also known as the translational apparatus.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Protein_biosynthesis", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ribosome", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ribozymes"]}
