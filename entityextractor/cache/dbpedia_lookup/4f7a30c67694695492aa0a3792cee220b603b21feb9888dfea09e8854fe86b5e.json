{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quantum_computing", "label": "Quantum computing", "abstract": "Quantum Computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. A quantum computer is used to perform such computation, which can be implemented theoretically or physically. There are two main approaches to physically implementing a quantum computer currently, analog and digital. Analog approaches are further divided into quantum simulation, quantum annealing, and adiabatic quantum computation. Digital quantum computers use quantum logic gates to do computation. Both approaches use quantum bits or qubits.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Classes_of_computers", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Computational_complexity_theory", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Computer-related_introductions_in_1980", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Emerging_technologies", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Information_theory", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Models_of_computation", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Open_problems", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_computing", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_cryptography", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Theoretical_computer_science"]}
