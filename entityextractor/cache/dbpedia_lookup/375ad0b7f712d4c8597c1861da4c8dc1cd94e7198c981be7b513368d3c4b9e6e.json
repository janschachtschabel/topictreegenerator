{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matter_wave", "label": "Matter wave", "abstract": "Matter waves are a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics, being an example of wave\u2013particle duality. All matter exhibits wave-like behavior. For example, a beam of electrons can be diffracted just like a beam of light or a water wave. In most cases, however, the wavelength is too small as to have a practical impact on day-to-day activities. Hence in our day-to-day lives with objects the size of tennis balls and people, matter waves are not relevant.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Foundational_quantum_physics", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Matter", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Waves"]}
