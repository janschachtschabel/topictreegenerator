{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Receptor_(biochemistry)", "label": "Receptor (biochemistry)", "abstract": "In biochemistry and pharmacology, receptors are chemical structures, composed of protein, that receive and transduce signals that may be integrated into biological systems. These signals are typically chemical messengers, which bind to a receptor, they cause some form of cellular/tissue response, e.g. a change in the electrical activity of a cell. There are three main ways the action of the receptor can be classified: relay of signal, amplification, or integration. Relaying sends the signal onward, amplification increases the effect of a single ligand, and integration allows the signal to be incorporated into another biochemical pathway. In this sense, a receptor is a protein-molecule that recognizes and responds to endogenous chemical signals. For example, an acetylcholine receptor recogn", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cell_biology", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cell_signaling", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Membrane_biology", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Receptors"]}
