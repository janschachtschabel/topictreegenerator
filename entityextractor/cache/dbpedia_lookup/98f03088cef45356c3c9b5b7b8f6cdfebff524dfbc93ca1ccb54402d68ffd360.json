{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coherence_(physics)", "label": "Coherence (physics)", "abstract": "In physics, two wave sources are perfectly coherent if they have a constant phase difference and the same frequency, and the same waveform. Coherence is an ideal property of waves that enables stationary (i.e. temporally and spatially constant) interference. It contains several distinct concepts, which are limiting cases that never quite occur in reality but allow an understanding of the physics of waves, and has become a very important concept in quantum physics. More generally, coherence describes all properties of the correlation between physical quantities of a single wave, or between several waves or wave packets.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Concepts_in_physics", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_mechanics", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Radar_signal_processing", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Wave_mechanics"]}
