{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spin_(physics)", "label": "Spin (physics)", "abstract": "In quantum mechanics and particle physics, spin is an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles, composite particles (hadrons), and atomic nuclei. Spin is one of two types of angular momentum in quantum mechanics, the other being orbital angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum operator is the quantum-mechanical counterpart to the classical angular momentum of orbital revolution and appears when there is periodic structure to its wavefunction as the angle varies. The existence of spin angular momentum is inferred from experiments, such as the Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment, in which silver atoms were observed to possess two possible discrete angular momenta despite having no orbital angular momentum.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Physical_quantities", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_field_theory", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Rotational_symmetry"]}
