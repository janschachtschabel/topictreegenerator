{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_division", "label": "Cell division", "abstract": "Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis), and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions. Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division, and sister chromatids are separated in the second division. Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1835_in_Germany", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1835_in_science", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cell_cycle", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cellular_processes", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Telomeres"]}
