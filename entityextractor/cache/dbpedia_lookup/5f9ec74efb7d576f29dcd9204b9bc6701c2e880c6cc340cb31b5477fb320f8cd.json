{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitosis", "label": "Mitosis", "abstract": "In cell biology, mitosis () is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the number of chromosomes is maintained. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of an animal cell cycle\u2014the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1835_in_science", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Articles_containing_video_clips", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cell_cycle", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mitosis"]}
