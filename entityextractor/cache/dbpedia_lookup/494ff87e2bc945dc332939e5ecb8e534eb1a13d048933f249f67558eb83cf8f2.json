Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of Satyendra Nath Bose, Indian physicist and professor of physics at University of Calcutta and at University of Dhaka in developing, with Albert Einstein, Bose\u2013Einstein statistics\u2014which theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Atomic_physics", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Bosons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Condensed_matter_physics", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_field_theory"]}
