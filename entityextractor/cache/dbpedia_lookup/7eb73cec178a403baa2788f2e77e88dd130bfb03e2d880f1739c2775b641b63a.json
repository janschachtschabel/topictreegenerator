{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fermion", "label": "Fermion", "abstract": "In particle physics, a fermion is a particle that follows Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics and generally has half odd integer spin 1/2, 3/2 etc. These particles obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Fermions include all quarks and leptons, as well as all composite particles made of an odd number of these, such as all baryons and many atoms and nuclei. Fermions differ from bosons, which obey Bose\u2013Einstein statistics. Composite fermions, such as protons and neutrons, are the key building blocks of everyday matter.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Enrico_Fermi", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Fermions", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_field_theory"]}
