{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quantum_tunnelling", "label": "Quantum tunnelling", "abstract": "Quantum tunnelling or tunneling (US) is the quantum mechanical phenomenon where a subatomic particle passes through a potential barrier. Quantum tunnelling is not predicted by the laws of classical mechanics where surmounting a potential barrier requires enough potential energy. Tunnelling is often explained in terms of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that the quantum object can be known as a wave or as a particle in general.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Articles_containing_video_clips", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Particle_physics", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_mechanics", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Solid_state_engineering"]}
