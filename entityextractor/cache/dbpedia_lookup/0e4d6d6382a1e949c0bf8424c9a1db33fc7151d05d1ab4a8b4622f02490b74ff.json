{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wave_function", "label": "Wave function", "abstract": "A wave function in quantum physics is a mathematical description of the quantum state of an isolated quantum system. The wave function is a complex-valued probability amplitude, and the probabilities for the possible results of measurements made on the system can be derived from it. The most common symbols for a wave function are the Greek letters \u03c8 and \u03a8 (lower-case and capital psi, respectively).", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_states", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Waves"]}
