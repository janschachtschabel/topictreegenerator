{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uncertainty_principle", "label": "Uncertainty principle", "abstract": "In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle (also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which the values for certain pairs of physical quantities of a particle, known as complementary variables or canonically conjugate variables such as position x and momentum p, can be predicted from initial conditions, or, depending on interpretation, to what extent such conjugate properties maintain their approximate meaning, as the mathematical framework of quantum physics does not support the notion of simultaneously well-defined conjugate properties expressed by a single value. The uncertainty principle implies that it is in general not possible to predict the value of a quantity with arbit", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1927_in_Germany", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1927_in_science", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Inequalities", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mathematical_physics", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Principles", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_mechanics", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Scientific_laws", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Werner_Heisenberg"]}
