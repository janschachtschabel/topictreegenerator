{"resource_uri": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pauli_exclusion_principle", "label": "Pauli exclusion principle", "abstract": "The Pauli exclusion principle is the quantum mechanical principle which states that two or more identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin) cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously. This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his spin\u2013statistics theorem of 1940.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Chemical_bonding", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Concepts_in_physics", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Lorentz_Medal_winners", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Pauli_exclusion_principle", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Spintronics"]}
