The material inside the nucleus and contained within the nuclear membrane is termed the nucleoplasm. The main components of the cytoplasm are cytosol \u2013 a gel-like substance, the organelles \u2013 the cell's internal sub-structures, and various cytoplasmic inclusions. The cytoplasm is about 80% water and usually colorless. Movement of calcium ions in and out of the cytoplasm is a signaling activity for metabolic processes.", "types": [], "categories": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cell_anatomy"]}
