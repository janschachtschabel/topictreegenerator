{"extract": "Faraday's law of induction (or simply Faraday's law) is a law of electromagnetism predicting how a magnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force (emf). This phenomenon, known as electromagnetic induction, is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors, and many types of electric motors, generators and solenoids.\nThe Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation (listed as one of Maxwell's equations) describes the fact that a spatially varying (and also possibly time-varying, depending on how a magnetic field varies in time) electric field always accompanies a time-varying magnetic field, while Faraday's law states that emf (electromagnetic work done on a unit charge when it has traveled one round of a conductive loop) appears on a conductive loop when the magnetic flux through the surface enclosed by the loop varies in time.\nOnce Faraday's law had been discovered, one aspect of it (transformer emf) was formulated as the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation. The equation of Faraday's law can be derived by the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation (describing transformer emf) and the Lorentz force (describing motional emf). The integral form of the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation describes only the transformer emf, while the equation of Faraday's law describes both the transformer emf and the motional emf.\n\n", "wikidata_id": "Q181465"}
