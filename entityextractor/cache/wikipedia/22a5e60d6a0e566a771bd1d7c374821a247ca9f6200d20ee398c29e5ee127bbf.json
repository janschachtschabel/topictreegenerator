{"extract": "Ernst Waldfried Josef Wenzel Mach ( MAHK; Austrian German: [\u025brnst max] ; 18 February 1838 \u2013 19 February 1916) was an Austrian physicist and philosopher, who contributed to the understanding of the physics of shock waves. The ratio of the speed of a flow or object to that of sound is named the Mach number in his honour. As a philosopher of science, he was a major influence on logical positivism and American pragmatism. Through his criticism of Isaac Newton's theories of space and time, he foreshadowed Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.", "wikidata_id": "Q93996"}
