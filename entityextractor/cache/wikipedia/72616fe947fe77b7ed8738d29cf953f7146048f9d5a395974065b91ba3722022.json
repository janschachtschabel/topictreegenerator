She showed intellectual aptitude from a young age and studied at Z\u00fcrich Polytechnic in a highly male dominated field, after having studied medicine for one semester at Z\u00fcrich University. Her studies included differential and integral calculus, descriptive and projective geometry, mechanics, theoretical physics, applied physics, experimental physics, and astronomy. One of her study colleagues at university was her future husband Albert Einstein, to whose early work Mari\u0107 is thought by some to have contributed (in particular the annus mirabilis papers).", "wikidata_id": "Q76346"}
