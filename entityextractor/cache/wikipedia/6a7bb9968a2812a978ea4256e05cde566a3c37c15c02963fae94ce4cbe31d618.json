{"extract": "In physics, the special theory of relativity, or special relativity for short, is a scientific theory of the relationship between space and time. In Albert Einstein's 1905 paper, \n\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\", the theory is presented as being based on just two postulates:\n\nThe laws of physics are invariant (identical) in all inertial frames of reference (that is, frames of reference with no acceleration). This is known as the principle of relativity.\nThe speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of light source or observer. This is known as the principle of light constancy, or the principle of light speed invariance.\nThe first postulate was first formulated by Galileo Galilei (see Galilean invariance).", "wikidata_id": "Q11455"}
