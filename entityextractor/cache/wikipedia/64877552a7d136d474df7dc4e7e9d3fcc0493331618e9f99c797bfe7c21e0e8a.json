{"extract": "Stereochemistry, a subdiscipline of chemistry, studies the spatial arrangement of atoms that form the structure of molecules and their manipulation. The study of stereochemistry focuses on the relationships between stereoisomers, which are defined as having the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution) but differing in the geometric positioning of the atoms in space. For this reason, it is also known as 3D chemistry\u2014the prefix \"stereo-\" means \"three-dimensionality\". Stereochemistry applies to all kinds of compounds and ions,  organic and inorganic species alike.  Stereochemistry affects biological, physical, and supramolecular chemistry. \nStereochemistry reactivity of the molecules in question (dynamic stereochemistry).", "wikidata_id": "Q186011"}
