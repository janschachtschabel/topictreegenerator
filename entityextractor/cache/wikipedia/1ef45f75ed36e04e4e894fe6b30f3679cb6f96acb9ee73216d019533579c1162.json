{"extract": "Wolfgang Ernst Pauli (; German: [\u02c8v\u0254lf\u0261a\u014b \u02c8\u025b\u0281nst \u02c8pa\u028ali]; 25 April 1900 \u2013 15 December 1958) was an Austrian theoretical physicist and a pioneer of quantum mechanics. In 1945, after having been nominated by Albert Einstein, Pauli received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his \"decisive contribution through his discovery of a new law of Nature, the exclusion principle or Pauli principle\". The discovery involved spin theory, which is the basis of a theory of the structure of matter. To preserve the conservation of energy in beta decay, he posited the existence of a small neutral particle, dubbed the neutrino by Enrico Fermi. The neutrino was detected in 1956.\n\n", "wikidata_id": "Q65989"}
