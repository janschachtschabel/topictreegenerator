{"extract": "In physics and mechanics, torque is the rotational analogue of linear force. It is also referred to as the moment of force (also abbreviated to moment). The symbol for torque is typically \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c4\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}}\n  \n, the lowercase Greek letter tau. When being referred to as moment of force, it is commonly denoted by M. Just as a linear force is a push or a pull applied to a body, a torque can be thought of as a twist applied to an object with respect to a chosen point; for example, driving a screw uses torque to force it into an object, which is applied by the screwdriver rotating around its axis to the drives on the head.", "wikidata_id": "Q48103"}
