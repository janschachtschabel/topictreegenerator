{"extract": "In physics, specifically electromagnetism, the Biot\u2013Savart law ( or ) is an equation describing the magnetic field generated by a constant electric current. It relates the magnetic field to the magnitude, direction, length, and proximity of the electric current. \nThe Biot\u2013Savart law is fundamental to magnetostatics. It is valid in the magnetostatic approximation and consistent with both Amp\u00e8re's circuital law and Gauss's law for magnetism. When magnetostatics does not apply, the Biot\u2013Savart law should be replaced by Jefimenko's equations. The law is named after Jean-Baptiste Biot and F\u00e9lix Savart, who discovered this relationship in 1820.\n\n", "wikidata_id": "Q171340"}
