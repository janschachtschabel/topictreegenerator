{"extract": "In physics, specifically electromagnetism, the magnetic flux through a surface is the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field B over that surface.  It is usually denoted \u03a6 or \u03a6B. The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb; in derived units, volt\u2013seconds or V\u22c5s), and the CGS unit is the maxwell. Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils, and it calculates the magnetic flux from the change of voltage on the coils.", "wikidata_id": "Q177831"}
