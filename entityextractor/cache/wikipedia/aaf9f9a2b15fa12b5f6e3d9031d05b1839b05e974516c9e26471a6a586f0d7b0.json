{"extract": "In physics, Lagrangian mechanics is a formulation of classical mechanics founded on the stationary-action principle (also known as the principle of least action). It was introduced by the Italian-French mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange in his presentation to the Turin Academy of Science in 1760 culminating in his 1788 grand opus, M\u00e9canique analytique.\nLagrangian mechanics describes a mechanical system as a pair (M, L) consisting of a configuration space M and a smooth function \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle L}\n  \n within that space called a Lagrangian. For many systems, L = T \u2212 V, where T and V are the kinetic and potential energy of the system, respectively.\nThe stationary action principle requires that the action functional of the system derived from L must remain at a stationary point (specifically, a maximum, minimum, or saddle point) throughout the time evolution of the system. This constraint allows the calculation of the equations of motion of the system using Lagrange's equations.\n\n", "wikidata_id": "Q324669"}
