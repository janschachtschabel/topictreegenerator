{"extract": "Hermann Minkowski ( ming-KAWF-skee, -\u2060KOF-; German: [m\u026a\u014b\u02c8k\u0254fski]; 22 June 1864 \u2013 12 January 1909) was a mathematician and professor at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg, the University of Z\u00fcrich, and the University of G\u00f6ttingen, described variously as German, Polish, Lithuanian-German, or Russian. He created and developed the geometry of numbers and elements of convex geometry, and used geometrical methods to solve problems in number theory, mathematical physics, and the theory of relativity.\nMinkowski is perhaps best known for his foundational work describing space and time as a four-dimensional space, now known as \"Minkowski spacetime\", which facilitated geometric interpretations of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity (1905).", "wikidata_id": "Q57246"}
