{"extract": "Spin is an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles, and thus by composite particles such as hadrons, atomic nuclei, and atoms.:\u200a183\u2013184\u200a Spin is quantized, and accurate models for the interaction with spin require relativistic quantum mechanics or quantum field theory.\nThe existence of electron spin angular momentum is inferred from experiments, such as the Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment, in which silver atoms were observed to possess two possible discrete angular momenta despite having no orbital angular momentum. The relativistic spin\u2013statistics theorem connects electron spin quantization to the Pauli exclusion principle: observations of exclusion imply half-integer spin, and observations of half-integer spin imply exclusion.\nSpin is described mathematically as a vector for some particles such as photons, and as a spinor or bispinor for other particles such as electrons. Spinors and bispinors behave similarly to vectors: they have definite magnitudes and change under rotations; however, they use an unconventional \"direction\". All elementary particles of a given kind have the same magnitude of spin angular momentum, though its direction may change. These are indicated by assigning the particle a spin quantum number.:\u200a183\u2013184\u200a\nThe SI units of spin are the same as classical angular momentum (i.e., N\u00b7m\u00b7s, J\u00b7s, or kg\u00b7m2\u00b7s\u22121). In quantum mechanics, angular momentum and spin angular momentum take discrete values proportional to the Planck constant. In practice, spin is usually given as a dimensionless spin quantum number by dividing the spin angular momentum by the reduced Planck constant \u0127. Often, the \"spin quantum number\" is simply called \"spin\".\n\n"}
