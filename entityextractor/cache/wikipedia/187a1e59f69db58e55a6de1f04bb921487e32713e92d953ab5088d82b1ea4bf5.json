{"extract": "The electron (e\u2212, or \u03b2\u2212 in nuclear reactions) is a subatomic particle with a negative one elementary electric charge.\nOrdinary matter is composed of atoms. Each atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by a number of electrons that neutralize its charge. Electrons are bound to the nucleus to different degrees: the least bound electrons are responsible for the bonds between atoms present in molecules and crystals, and for all types of chemical reactions, while the rest make up the atomic core.\nElectrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena. In metals, highly mobile electrons are responsible for their high electrical and thermal conductivity. In semiconductors, the number of mobile electrons is easily influenced by the material's composition, temperature, applied voltage or irradiation. This is the basis of semiconductor electronics. Electrons can escape from their atoms and materials, and as free electrons form particle beams in a vacuum, be further accelerated and focused. This has enabled the development of the cathode-ray tubes, X-ray tubes, electron microscopes, electron beam welding, research by means of particle accelerators and the generation of synchrotron radiation. \n\n", "wikidata_id": "Q2225"}
