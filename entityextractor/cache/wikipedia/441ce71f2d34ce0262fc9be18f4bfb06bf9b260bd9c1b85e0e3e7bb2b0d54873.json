{"extract": "In classical mechanics, impulse (symbolized by J or Imp) is the change in momentum of an object. If the initial momentum of an object is p1, and a subsequent momentum is p2, the object has received an impulse J:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          J\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            p\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            p\n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {J} =\\mathbf {p} _{2}-\\mathbf {p} _{1}.}\n  \n\nMomentum is a vector quantity, so impulse is also a vector quantity: \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2211\n        \n          F\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \u0394\n        t\n        =\n        \u0394\n        \n          p\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sum \\mathbf {F} \\times \\Delta t=\\Delta \\mathbf {p} .}\n  \n \nNewton\u2019s second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is equal to the resultant force F acting on the object:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  p\n                \n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2212\n              \n                \n                  p\n                \n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \u0394\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} ={\\frac {\\mathbf {p} _{2}-\\mathbf {p} _{1}}{\\Delta t}},}\n  \n\nso the impulse J delivered by a steady force F acting for time \u0394t is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          J\n        \n        =\n        \n          F\n        \n        \u0394\n        t\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {J} =\\mathbf {F} \\Delta t.}\n  \n\nThe impulse delivered by a varying force acting from time a to b is the integral of the force F with respect to time:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          J\n        \n        =\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        \n          F\n        \n        \n        \n          d\n        \n        t\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {J} =\\int _{a}^{b}\\mathbf {F} \\,\\mathrm {d} t.}\n  \n\nThe SI unit of impulse is the newton second (N\u22c5s), and the dimensionally equivalent unit of momentum is the kilogram metre per second (kg\u22c5m/s).
