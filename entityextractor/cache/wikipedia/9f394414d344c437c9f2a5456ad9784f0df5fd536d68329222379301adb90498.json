{"extract": "The Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, is a research institute for investigations of complex non-equilibrium systems, particularly in physics and biology.\nIts founding history goes back to Ludwig Prandtl who in 1911 requested a Kaiser Wilhelm Institute to be founded for the investigation of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. As a first step the Aeronautische Versuchsanstalt (now the DLR) was established in 1915 and then finally the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Flow Research was established in 1924. In 1948 it became part of the Max Planck Society. The Max Planck Society was founded in this institute. In 2003 it was renamed to Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization. It is one of 80 institutes in the Max Planck Society (Max Planck Gesellschaft).", "wikidata_id": "Q277098"}
