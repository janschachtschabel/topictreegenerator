{"extract": "Max Born (German: [\u02c8maks \u02c8b\u0254\u0281n] ; 11 December 1882 \u2013 5 January 1970) was a German-British theoretical physicist who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics, and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born shared the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics with Walther Bothe \"for his fundamental research in quantum mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function\".\nBorn entered the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1904, where he met the three renowned mathematicians Felix Klein, David Hilbert, and Hermann Minkowski. He wrote his PhD thesis on the subject of the stability of elastic wires and tapes, winning the university's Philosophy Faculty Prize. In 1905, he began researching special relativity with Minkowski, and subsequently wrote his habilitation thesis on the Thomson model of the atom. A chance meeting with Fritz Haber in Berlin in 1918 led to discussion of how an ionic compound is formed when a metal reacts with a halogen, which is today known as the Born\u2013Haber cycle.\nIn World War I he was originally placed as a radio  operator, but his specialist knowledge led to his being moved to research duties on sound ranging. In 1921 Born returned to G\u00f6ttingen, where he arranged another chair for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck. Under Born, G\u00f6ttingen became one of the world's foremost centres for physics. In 1925 Born and Werner Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. The following year, he formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for \u03c8*\u03c8 in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. His influence extended far beyond his own research. Max Delbr\u00fcck, Siegfried Fl\u00fcgge, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim, Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf all received their PhD degrees under Born at G\u00f6ttingen, and his assistants included Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, Gerhard Herzberg, Friedrich Hund, Wolfgang Pauli, L\u00e9on Rosenfeld, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner.\nIn January 1933, the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, and Born, who was Jewish, was suspended from his professorship at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he took a job at St John's College, Cambridge, and wrote a popular science book, The Restless Universe, as well as Atomic Physics, which soon became a standard textbook. In October 1936, he became the Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, where, working with German-born assistants E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs, he continued his research into physics. Born became a naturalised British subject on 31 August 1939, one day before World War II broke out in Europe. He remained in Edinburgh until 1952. He retired to Bad Pyrmont, in West Germany, and died in a hospital in G\u00f6ttingen on 5 January 1970.\n\n", "wikidata_id": "Q58978"}
