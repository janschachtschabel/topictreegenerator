{"extract": "Induction cooking is a cooking process using direct electrical induction heating of cookware, rather than relying on flames or heating elements. Induction cooking allows high power and very rapid increases in temperature to be achieved: changes in heat settings are instantaneous.\nPots or pans with suitable bases are placed on an induction electric stove (also induction hob or induction cooktop) which generally has a heat-proof glass-ceramic surface above a coil of copper wire with an alternating electric current passing through it. The resulting oscillating magnetic field induces an electrical current in the cookware, which is converted into heat by resistance. \nTo work with induction, cookware must contain a ferromagnetic metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. Induction tops typically will not heat copper or aluminum cookware because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current.\nInduction cooking is among the most efficient ways of cooking, which means it produces less waste heat and it can be quickly turned on and off. Induction has safety advantages compared to gas stoves and emits no air pollution into the kitchen. Cooktops are also usually easy to clean, because the cooktop itself has a smooth surface and does not get very hot. When moving heavy pans, (such as cast-iron pans, it is important to lift the pan to avoid scratching the glass surface.\n\n", "wikidata_id": "Q751960"}
