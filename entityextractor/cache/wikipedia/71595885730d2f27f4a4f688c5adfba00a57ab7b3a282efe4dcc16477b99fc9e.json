{"extract": "In electricity generation, a generator, also called an electric generator, electrical generator, and electromagnetic generator is an electromechanical device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy for use in an external circuit.  In most generators which are rotating machines, a source of kinetic power rotates the generator's shaft, and the generator produces an electric current at its output terminals which flows through an external circuit, powering electrical loads.  Sources of mechanical energy used to drive generators include steam turbines, gas turbines, water turbines, internal combustion engines, wind turbines and even hand cranks. Generators produce nearly all of the electric power for worldwide electric power grids.  The first electromagnetic generator, the Faraday disk, was invented in 1831 by British scientist Michael Faraday.\nThe reverse conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is done by an electric motor, and motors and generators are very similar. Some motors can be used in a \"backward\" sense as generators, if their shaft is rotated they will generate electric power.\nIn addition to its most common usage for electromechanical generators described above, the term generator is also used for photovoltaic, fuel cell, and magnetohydrodynamic powered devices that use solar power and chemical fuels, respectively, to generate electrical power.\n\n", "wikidata_id": "Q131502"}
