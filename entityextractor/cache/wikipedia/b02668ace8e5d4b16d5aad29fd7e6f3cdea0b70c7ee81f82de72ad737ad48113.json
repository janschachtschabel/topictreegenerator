The same amount of work is done by the object when decelerating from its current speed to a state of rest.\nThe SI unit of energy is the joule, while the English unit of energy is the foot-pound.\nIn relativistic mechanics, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        m\n        \n          v\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}\n  \n is a good approximation of kinetic energy only when v is much less than the speed of light.\n\n", "wikidata_id": "Q46276"}
