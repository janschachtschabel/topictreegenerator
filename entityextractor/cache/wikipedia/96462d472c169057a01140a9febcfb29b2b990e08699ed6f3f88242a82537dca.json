{"extract": "The ideal gas law, also called the general gas equation, is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. It is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. It was first stated by Beno\u00eet Paul \u00c9mile Clapeyron in 1834 as a combination of the empirical Boyle's law, Charles's law, Avogadro's law, and Gay-Lussac's law. The ideal gas law is often written in an empirical form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        V\n        =\n        n\n        R\n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle pV=nRT}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n  \n are the pressure, volume and temperature respectively; \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n is the amount of substance; and \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  \n is the ideal gas constant.\nIt can also be derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, as was achieved (apparently independently) by August Kr\u00f6nig in 1856 and Rudolf Clausius in 1857.\n\n", "wikidata_id": "Q191785"}
