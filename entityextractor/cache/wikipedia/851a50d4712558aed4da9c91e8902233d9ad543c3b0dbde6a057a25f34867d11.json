{"extract": "Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington,  (28 December 1882 \u2013 22 November 1944) was an English astronomer, physicist, and mathematician. He was also a philosopher of science and a populariser of science. The Eddington limit, the natural limit to the luminosity of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object, is named in his honour.\nAround 1920, he foreshadowed the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper \"The Internal Constitution of the Stars\". At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington was the first to correctly speculate that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium.\nEddington wrote a number of articles that announced and explained Einstein's theory of general relativity to the English-speaking world. World War I had severed many lines of scientific communication, and new developments in German science were not well known in England. He also conducted an expedition to observe the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 on the Island of Pr\u00edncipe that provided one of the earliest confirmations of general relativity, and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.", "wikidata_id": "Q215022"}
