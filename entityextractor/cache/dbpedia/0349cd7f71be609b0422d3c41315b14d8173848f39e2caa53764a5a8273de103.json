The standard unit of organisation is the trade union. \n* The political labour movement in many countries includes a political party that represents the interests of employees, often known as a \"labour party\" or \"workers' party\". Many individuals and political groups otherwise considered to represent ruling classes may be part of, and active in, the labour movement. The labour movement developed as a response to the industrial capitalism of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, at about the same time as socialism.", "types": ["http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatMovements", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Motion100331950", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Change100191142", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Action100037396", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Act100030358", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Event100029378", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatSocialMovements", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Movement108464601", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SocialGroup107950920", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Group100031264", "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PersonFunction", "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country", "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace", "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place"], "comment": "The labour movement or labor movement consists of two main wings: the trade union movement (British English) or labor union movement (American English) on the one hand, and the political labour movement on the other.
