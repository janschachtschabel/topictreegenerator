The wave function is a complex-valued probability amplitude, and the probabilities for the possible results of measurements made on the system can be derived from it. The most common symbols for a wave function are the Greek letters \u03c8 and \u03a8 (lower-case and capital psi, respectively). The wave function is a function of the degrees of freedom corresponding to some maximal set of commuting observables. Once such a representation is chosen, the wave function can be derived from the quantum state. For a given system, the choice of which commuting degrees of freedom to use is not unique, and correspondingly the domain of the wave function is also not unique. For instance, it may be taken to be a function of all the position coordinates of the particles over position space, or the momenta of all the particles over momentum space; the two are related by a Fourier transform. Some particles, like electrons and photons, have nonzero spin, and the wave function for such particles include spin as an intrinsic, discrete degree of freedom; other discrete variables can also be included, such as isospin. When a system has internal degrees of freedom, the wave function at each point in the continuous degrees of freedom (e.g., a point in space) assigns a complex number for each possible value of the discrete degrees of freedom (e.g., z-component of spin) \u2013 these values are often displayed in a column matrix (e.g., a 2 \u00d7 1 column vector for a non-relativistic electron with spin 1\u20442). According to the superposition principle of quantum mechanics, wave functions can be added together and multiplied by complex numbers to form new wave functions and form a Hilbert space. The inner product between two wave functions is a measure of the overlap between the corresponding physical states and is used in the foundational probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, the Born rule, relating transition probabilities to inner products. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation determines how wave functions evolve over time, and a wave function behaves qualitatively like other waves, such as water waves or waves on a string, because the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is mathematically a type of wave equation. This explains the name \"wave function\", and gives rise to wave\u2013particle duality. However, the wave function in quantum mechanics describes a kind of physical phenomenon, still open to different interpretations, which fundamentally differs from that of classic mechanical waves. In Born's statistical interpretation in non-relativistic quantum mechanics,the squared modulus of the wave function, |\u03c8|2, is a real number interpreted as the probability density of measuring a particle as being at a given place \u2013 or having a given momentum \u2013 at a given time, and possibly having definite values for discrete degrees of freedom. The integral of this quantity, over all the system's degrees of freedom, must be 1 in accordance with the probability interpretation. This general requirement that a wave function must satisfy is called the normalization condition. Since the wave function is complex-valued, only its relative phase and relative magnitude can be measured\u2014its value does not, in isolation, tell anything about the magnitudes or directions of measurable observables; one has to apply quantum operators, whose eigenvalues correspond to sets of possible results of measurements, to the wave function \u03c8 and calculate the statistical distributions for measurable quantities.", "types": ["http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/WikicatConceptsInPhysics", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Concept105835747", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Idea105833840", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Content105809192", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Cognition100023271", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PsychologicalFeature100023100", "http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Abstraction100002137", "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Planet", "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/CelestialBody", "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place"], "comment": "A wave function in quantum physics is a mathematical description of the quantum state of an isolated quantum system.
